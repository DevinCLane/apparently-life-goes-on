# apparently-life-goes-on

A Max/MSP patch using the Vsynth library

## Download instructions:

- Requires a copy of Max and the Vsynth library (found in the Max Package Manager)
- Click green `code` button and either download as Zip or copy URL/SSH and in your terminal `git clone 'the URL here'`

## Run instructions

- Find the `render` module and press 'on'
- Press `read` and load in the presets, then try clicking the squares for some presets of mine, or start moving knobs and see the fun!

## Further notes
- 'apparently-life-goes-on-recording.maxpat' is the patch that I used to blend the video synthesis with my guitar video performance
